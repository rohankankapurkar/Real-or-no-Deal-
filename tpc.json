        "text": "Apple users are a loyal bunch, and Apple rewards them accordingly. However, there is a scam that is currently being pulled in Australia and North America using Apple\u2019s good name to cheat people out of their personal identification information.The scam involves discount \u201creward\u201d cards to thank customers for their loyalty to the brand.The scammers send an email to Apple customers, notifying them of their eligibility for a discount card. The email is titled \u201cApple Discount Card\u201d and the body of the email reads as follows: \"Dear Apple Customer, Apple is pleasing its long-standing customers. You are suitable for purchasing an Apple Discount Card as you are loyal to our products. With only this 9AU$ discount card, you will have 100AU$ CREDIT at an Apple store or log on to: //www.apple.com/au/\".The email then goes on to say that after the 9AU$ payment is made the customer will receive their Apple Discount Card through email within 24 hours. It also states that in order to verify eligibility, the customer must provide their details such as name, address, date of birth, driver\u2019s license number, mother\u2019s maiden name and credit card details for payment.Using this information the scammers will then steal the victim\u2019s identity. Worse, the scammers will further use the information to hack the victim\u2019s online accounts. This effectively ruins the victim\u2019s credit and online financial reputation as well."

Who says \u201ccall us on\u2026\u201d Anyone that thinks this email is convincing should take a second guess by Googling the phone number \u201c1-800-462-0049.\u201d You will see it leads to scam results of many people reporting suspicious activity."
