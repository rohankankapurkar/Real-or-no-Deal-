Apple users are a loyal bunch, and Apple rewards them accordingly. However, there is a scam that is currently being pulled in Australia and North America using Apple’s good name to cheat people out of their personal identification information.The scam involves discount “reward” cards to thank customers for their loyalty to the brand.The scammers send an email to Apple customers, notifying them of their eligibility for a discount card. The email is titled “Apple Discount Card” and the body of the email reads as follows: "Dear Apple Customer, Apple is pleasing its long-standing customers. You are suitable for purchasing an Apple Discount Card as you are loyal to our products. With only this 9AU$ discount card, you will have 100AU$ CREDIT at an Apple store or log on to: //www.apple.com/au/".The email then goes on to say that after the 9AU$ payment is made the customer will receive their Apple Discount Card through email within 24 hours. It also states that in order to verify eligibility, the customer must provide their details such as name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, mother’s maiden name and credit card details for payment.Using this information the scammers will then steal the victim’s identity. Worse, the scammers will further use the information to hack the victim’s online accounts. This effectively ruins the victim’s credit and online financial reputation as well.

This Amazon password reset scam almost looks like a real email from Amazon at first glance; but it’s not! This email only uses Amazon’s logo impersonating the company. They also claim to provide you with a six-digit number to verify your identity. (this is a bogus number.) Do NOT call the phone number.The verbiage seems like something you’d expect to see from a typical security alert email until you see the phone number and phrase “Please call us on…” Who talks like that? Who says “call us on…” Anyone that thinks this email is convincing should take a second guess by Googling the phone number “1-800-462-0049.” You will see it leads to scam results of many people reporting suspicious activity.
